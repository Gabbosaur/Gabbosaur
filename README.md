Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile! I'm Gabriele, a passionate developer with a strong love for AI, computer vision, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction. Iâ€™m always looking for creative ways to blend my interests, which include fitness, photography, and language learning.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Exploring AI-driven solutions, particularly in fitness applications, where I combine my passion for calisthenics with technology to create innovative tools.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: More advanced techniques in computer vision and NLP, and constantly pushing the boundaries of human-computer interaction to make tech more intuitive and accessible.
- ðŸ“· Another passion: Photography! I specialize in portrait photography and enjoy capturing authentic moments and experimenting with visual storytelling. Check out my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gabbokeh) to see some of my favorite shots!
- ðŸ’ª Life outside tech: Calisthenics is a big part of my routine, and Iâ€™m always up for finding new places/parks to workout and meet new people.
- ðŸŒŽ Languages I speak: English, Italian, and Chinese fluently. Iâ€™m also practicing my Spanish and French, and Iâ€™d love to start learning German, Japanese, Turkish, and Russian.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Open-source projects in AI, especially those involving computer vision, fitness tech, or language-based applications. If you have an idea in any of these fields, letâ€™s chat!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Connect with me on LinkedIn or drop me an email at gabriele.guo@gmail.com.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m always trying to find the intersection of my interests and techâ€”whether it's through AI-enhanced fitness apps or tools that make language learning easier.

If we have something in common or you just want to connect, feel free to reach out. See ya somewhere in the tech world! ðŸ˜Š
